# Share-Price-Forecasting-using-Facebook-Prophet
Data Description:

The data represents historical Amazon share price information, downloaded from Yahoo Finance.
Columns:

Date: Represents the date of the stock price observation (likely in YYYY-MM-DD format).
Open: The price of the stock at the beginning of the trading day.
High: The highest price the stock reached during the trading day.
Low: The lowest price the stock reached during the trading day.
Close: The price of the stock at the end of the trading day.
Adj Close: The adjusted closing price, which accounts for any corporate actions like stock splits or dividends. This is often considered the most important price for analysis.
Volume: The number of shares traded during the day.
Derived Columns:

ds: Created specifically for the Prophet model, representing the dates (same as 'Date' but in a format Prophet expects).
y: The target variable for forecasting, representing the 'Adj Close' price (the value that the model aims to predict).

Data Types:

Date/ds:  datetime  representing dates.
Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, y: Likely numerical (float or integer) representing prices.
Volume:  numerical (integer) representing the number of shares traded.

Data Scope:

The data covers a period of Amazon's historical share prices.
The code splits the data into training and testing sets using a specific date ('2019-07-21') to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
Overall:

The dataset provides daily information about Amazon's stock performance, including opening, high, low, closing, and adjusted closing prices, as well as trading volume. This data is used to train and evaluate a time series forecasting model using Facebook Prophet to predict future stock prices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Process:
The code performs time series forecasting of Amazon share prices using Facebook Prophet:

1. Data Setup:

Load data: Reads Amazon share price data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
Clean and Explore: Checks for missing values and creates an initial plot of 'Adj Close' price over time.
Prepare for Prophet: Crucially, creates new columns 'ds' (dates) and 'y' (target variable 'Adj Close'), keeping only these for Prophet's input.
2. Modeling and Forecasting:

Create and Train Models: Two Prophet models are built: model1 uses only the time series data (ds and y), and model incorporates additional regressors ('Volume', 'High', 'Low').
Generate Forecasts: Predictions are made on a test dataset using both models.
3. Evaluation and Visualization:

Assess Performance: Standard metrics like MSE, MAE, and MAPE are calculated to evaluate the accuracy of the forecasts.
Visualize Results: Prophet's built-in plotting functions are used to visualize the forecasts, trend, and seasonality components.
In essence, the code follows these key steps:

Get the data ready for Prophet.
Train Prophet models to learn patterns in the data.
Forecast future share prices.
Check how good the forecasts are.
Visualize the predictions and the components that influence them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion:
. Prophet's Forecasting Ability:

The code demonstrates Prophet's ability to forecast Amazon's stock prices, albeit with a certain degree of error.
The performance metrics (MSE, MAE, MAPE) give an indication of the model's accuracy on the test data, allowing you to assess how well it generalizes to unseen data points.
2. Impact of Regressors:

By comparing the results of model1 (using only time series data) and model (with additional regressors), you can potentially infer the influence of factors like trading volume, high, and low prices on the prediction accuracy.
If model performs better than model1, it suggests that these regressors provide valuable information for forecasting.
3. Trend and Seasonality:

The plots generated by model1.plot_components and model.plot_components reveal insights into the trend and seasonality patterns of Amazon's stock prices.
You can observe the overall direction of the trend (upward or downward), identify any seasonal patterns (e.g., daily, weekly, yearly) that influence the stock price, and potentially use this information for future analysis or decision-making.
4. Model Limitations:

Even with Prophet, stock price forecasting is complex and subject to limitations.
The model's accuracy is likely to be limited by factors like market volatility, unexpected events, and the inherent unpredictability of financial markets.
It's essential to acknowledge that the model's predictions are not guarantees but rather probabilistic estimates.
